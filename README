Chrome Frame (HTML)
===================

I loved Kerem's idea (http://dribbble.com/shots/395812-Chrome-freebie-PSD) for creating an easy-to-use template when showing mockups, so I thought I would rebound with an HTML version. I'm sure there can be improvements (namely IE), but wanted to share if it would be helpful to anyone. Cheers!

- Fully responsive
- Frame resizes to fit image
- Buttons work if you want to use them for navigation
